# Nuclear Messenger üöÄ

This repository contains an educational project focused on developing the frontend for a messenger application. The core challenge and goal of this project is to build a modern user interface **from scratch, without using any third-party frameworks** like React, Vue, or Angular.

The project meticulously translates a professional design prototype from Figma into a functional, multi-page web application.
